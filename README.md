# [BaseJava course (updated and redesigned)](http://javaops.ru/reg/basejava)

## Development of a web application "Resume Database

In this course, you will create a web application from scratch, implementing different ways to store resumes. The project includes the following:
  - **Technology:** Java 8, GitHub/Git, JUnit, Logging, GSON, JAXB, SQL, PostgreSQL, Servlets, HTML, JSP, JSTL, Tomcat, Maven and much more
  - **Different ways to implement resume storage:**
     - in sorted and unsorted array
     - in collections (List, Map)
     - in the file system:
        - using File and Path API
        - in standard and custom Java serialization
        - in JSON format ([Google Gson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gson))
        - in XML format ([JAXB](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Architecture_for_XML_Binding))
     -  in a relational database [PostgreSQL](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)
  - **Installation (deploy) of the web application:**
     - into a servlet container [Tomcat](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat)
     - to the cloud service [Heroku](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku)

> Any knowledge should be taken as a kind of semantic tree: make sure you understand the fundamental principles, that is, the trunk and large branches, before climbing into the small leaves-details. Otherwise, the latter will have nothing to hold on to
